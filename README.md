# AI-for-Giants
this Minecraft world has some command blocks that give the Minecraft giant mob some boss AI
You can use creative mode to get armor/tools, or use "/trigger kit", which gives you some armor that has protection and blast protection.
You can also use "/trigger SpawnEgg", which gives you a "Giant Spawn Egg". Place it down to summon the giant.
(This world was made in 1.19)
